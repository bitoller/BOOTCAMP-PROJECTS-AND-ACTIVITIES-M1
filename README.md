# BOOTCAMP PROJECTS AND ACTIVITIES
I'll be posting here all the activities and projects I had to code during my Fullstack bootcamp at Kenzie Academy so I can show my progress from zero all the way to a Fullstack Developer.

## S1-06-M1 - "[MEU WEBSITE](https://bitoller.github.io/Bootcamp-Projects-and-Activities/src/M1-SPRINT-1/S1-06-M1.html)"
For my first project I had to clone a part of a website adding all the `markups`, `titles` and `hyperlinks`, always making sure I followed the right semantics.

## S1-12-M1 - "[PÁGINA DE PERFIL](https://bitoller.github.io/Bootcamp-Projects-and-Activities/src/M1-SPRINT-1/S1-12-M1.html)"
For my second project I had to code a profile page with my personal information adding `lists`, `hyperlinks`, `titles` and following the right semantics.

## S1-18-M1 - "[FORMULÁRIO DE CADASTRO](https://bitoller.github.io/Bootcamp-Projects-and-Activities/src/M1-SPRINT-1/S1-18-M1.html)"
For my third project I had to code a registration form adding different `input` tags like `password`, `radio`, `submit button` and more following the right semantics.
