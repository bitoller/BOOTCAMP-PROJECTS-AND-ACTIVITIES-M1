# BOOTCAMP PROJECTS AND ACTIVITIES
I'll be posting here all the activities and projects I had to code during my Fullstack bootcamp at Kenzie Academy so I can show my progress from zero all the way to a Fullstack Developer.

<hr />

The `S` stands for `SPRINT` <strong>e.g.</strong> `S1` means `SPRINT 1`.<br />
The numbers are the class numbers. Every class had a name and a number.<br />
The `M` stands for `Modules` <strong>e.g.</strong> `M1` means `Module 1`. That's how the bootcamp curriculum is separated.
