# BOOTCAMP PROJECTS AND ACTIVITIES
I'll be posting here all the activities and projects I had to code during my Fullstack bootcamp at Kenzie Academy so I can show my progress from zero all the way to a Fullstack Developer.

## S1-06-M1 - "[MEU WEBSITE](https://bitoller.github.io/Bootcamp-Projects-and-Activities/src/M1-SPRINT-1/S1-06-M1.html)"
For my first activity I had to clone a part of a website adding all the `markups`, `titles` and `hyperlinks`, always making sure I followed the right semantics.

## S1-12-M1 - "[PÁGINA DE PERFIL](https://bitoller.github.io/Bootcamp-Projects-and-Activities/src/M1-SPRINT-1/S1-12-M1.html)"
For my second activity I had to code a profile page with my personal information adding `lists`, `hyperlinks`, `titles` and following the right semantics.

## S1-18-M1 - "[FORMULÁRIO DE CADASTRO](https://bitoller.github.io/Bootcamp-Projects-and-Activities/src/M1-SPRINT-1/S1-18-M1.html)"
For my third activity I had to code a registration form adding different `input` tags like `password`, `radio`, `submit button` and more following the right semantics.

## S1-26-M1 - "[BLOG DA KENZIE](https://bitoller.github.io/Bootcamp-Projects-and-Activities/src/M1-SPRINT-1/S1-26-M1.html)"
For my fourth activity I had to code a simple blog adding 4 favorite articles from Kenzie Academy properly linking the source page using `article`, `a href`, `target blank` and more. I also had to add a Newsletter email `input` and `submit` button.
